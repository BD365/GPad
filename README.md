Thanks to them and other creative people who made bits of information & code available.

These sources are the base to tinker this Gamepad/opentrack solution to use with a gamepad and opentrack (FreePie EMU on smartphone) and USB Monitor solution (to display steam vr on phone).

This is an experiment for me (usage Git, usage openvr, en c++, vr (going for cheap/testing, not the better, full immersive kind (which is less cheap)))!

Known issues:
movement doesn't work as i want it: probably sync with HMD and vive (simulated) not ok, probably going to start new repo (if i get that fixed).
